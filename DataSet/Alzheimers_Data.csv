id9792,"A2M, LRP1 (encoding the alpha-2M receptor) and the genes for two other LRP ligands, APOE and APP (encoding the amyloid beta-protein precursor), have now all been genetically linked to AD, suggesting that these proteins may participate in a common neuropathogenic pathway leading to AD.",A
id9806,"The A2M receptor, A2M-r/LRP, is a multifunctional receptor whose ligands include apolipoprotein E and the amyloid precursor protein. These four proteins have each been genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that they may participate in a common disease pathway.",A
id9801,Recent reports have suggested that variability in the alpha2-macroglobulin gene is a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Our results fail to show an association between this polymorphism and disease.,N
id9796,"The alpha-2 macroglobulin five-nucleotide deletion (A2M-2) allele frequency was not significantly higher in the AD group than the control group (0.062 versus 0.101, p > 0.1).",N
id9797,We conclude that  there is no genetic association between A2M and AD in our case-control sample.,N
id9812,We examined the distribution of A2M genotypes and alleles in a cohort of 146 AD patients and 160 age-matched non-demented individuals. There was no evidence for association in the total sample or in subsets stratified by age or APOE epsilon4 status.,N
id9807,"This is the first report to study the frequencies of A2M-2 in Japanese AD cases, suggesting its no genetic association with sporadic AD.",N
id9795,An association between a five-base-pair deletion/insertion DNA polymorphism at the alpha(2) macroglobulin gene (A2M) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) has been recently described. Our work suggests that the D allele confers an age-dependent increased risk to develop late-onset Alzheimer's disease.,Y
id9803,The alpha2-macroglobulin gene (A2M) has been suggested as a candidate locus for AD based on analysis of familial AD... No evidence was observed for an association between the thiolester polymorphism and AD alone or when accounting for the APOE-epsilon4 allele.,N
id9804,Our data support an association between the A2M gene and AD.,Y
id9809,The A2M polymorphism does not affect the development of sporadic AD or formation of AD-type neuropathologic changes.,N
id9800,"Two genetic markers of the plasma protein alpha2-macroglobulin, a 5 bp deletion/insertion at the 5' splice site of exon 18 (A2MI) and the GTC/ATC (VaIIO00IIe) in exon 24 (A2M2), may have roles in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Comparison of genotype and allele frequencies, stratification of the samples by the presence of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele, and logistic regression analysis revealed no association of these markers with AD in either racial group.",N
id9815,"Our results failed to demonstrate an association between this polymorphism and Japanese sporadic AD, and the A2M I1000V mutation does not seem to be a risk factor per se for sporadic AD.",N
id25890,The results from this study indicate that polymorphisms in LRP and A2M are not associated with increased risk for AD in Northern Ireland.,N
id9790,Recent reports have suggested that genetic polymorphisms in the alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M) gene are associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease... This study failed to show an association between the two investigated polymorphisms in the alpha-2 macroglobulin gene and any of the four different psychogeriatric patient subgroups,N
id9762,"To evaluate the genetic factors for AD among a Chinese population in Taiwan, we studied the polymorphisms of six candidate genes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the regulatory region of apolipoprotein E (Apo-E, G-186T), the promoter of apolipoprotein E (Apo-E, A-491T), the bleomycin hydrolase gene (BH, A1450G), a mutation of alpha(2)-macroglobulin gene (A2M G2998A), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene (LRP, C766T), and alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin gene (ACT, -15Ala/Thr) in AD patients and non-affected elder individuals among Taiwanese Chinese... Among these nine candidate genes of AD, the ApoE-4 allele is the only independent genetic risk factor for AD.",N
id9772,Our findings do not support the fact that the previously reported positive association between A2M deletion polymorphism and AD modifies the disease risk in the studied population.,N
id9791,Our data do not support a role for the A2M gene as genetic risk factor for AD.,N
id9781,Our data suggests that the A2M D allele is a modest risk factor for late-onset sporadic AD in Koreans and the AD risk conferred by the A2M D allele increases in APOE epsilon4 negative subjects.,Y
id9782,"In conclusion, we observed no association between either the intronic deletion polymorphism or the Ile1000Val polymorphism of A2M and AD in our case-control cohort.",N
id9776,"Our results do not support previously reported association of ACT and A2M with LOAD, at least in Korean population.",N
id27280,"The genes chosen for analysis were; low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1), angiotensin converting enzyme (DCP1), alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH), dihydrolipoyl S-succinyltransferase (DLST), tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (TNFRSF6), nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2), butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE), Fe65 (APBB1), oestrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), cathepsin D (CTSD), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and interleukin 1A (IL1A). We found no strong evidence of association for any of these loci with AD in this population.",N
id9786,Our results did not show any significant difference between A2M-2 allelic frequency (p = 0.89) or genotype frequency (p = 0.97) in the two different clinical series and in control subjects. The frequencies were not significantly different after stratification by APOE epsilon4 status.,N
id9777,The above data demonstrate that there is no evidence for the association of A2M polymorphism with the development of LOAD in the Han Chinese population in Gaungzhou.,N
id9774,The results from this study indicate that polymorphisms in LRP and A2M are not associated with increased risk for AD in Northern Ireland.,N
id9787,"Our data suggest that, although A2M has an important role in the AD-specific neurodegenerative process, its exon 24 Val-1000-Ile polymorphism is not likely to be associated with late-onset sporadic AD in the Hungarian population.",Y
id9788,The lack of statistically significant difference between G/G frequencies in both groups of patients may suggest that alpha 2-macroglobulin G/G genotype is not a risk factor for AD.,A
id9783,"The acute-phase ""panproteinase"" inhibitor alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M), a protein involved in inflammatory reactions, has been identified in amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD)... No difference was found in the alpha2M mean plasma levels associated with the three alpha2M genotypes, indicating that the deletion has no effect on alpha2M protein level. However, in AD patients alpha2M mean plasma values differed significantly according to apolipoprotein E genotypes (p=0.03), with E3/E3 homozygotes showing the highest levels.",N
id9784,Moreover subjects carrying the A2M genotype I/I-Val/Val had a threefold increase of risk for AD. ,Y
id9770,"Five candidate genes were chosen: apolipoprotein E (APOE), alpha 2-macroglobulin, cathepsin D, myeloperoxidase and nitric oxide synthase. Genotyping was performed in 100 cases of late-onset AD and 100 healthy controls. We found a highly significant difference in APOE epsilon 4 distribution between groups (P<0.005). However, no evidence of association for other studied loci was found.",N
id9763,"To overcome this limitation, nine polymorphisms in seven different candidate genes (A2M, ACT, APOE, APP, BH, HSP70-2, and IL1-A) were genotyped. Except for the APOE gene, allele and genotype frequencies were not different between cases and controls, even when stratifying for the APOE genotype.",N
id9778,These results indicated that A2M-D allele was probably a weak AD protective factor and there was a possible interaction of APOE-epsilon4 and A2M-G alleles to increase AD risk in Mainland Han Chinese.,Y
id9794,"Our results showed that there is no association between the I/D polymorphisms of ACE and A2M with AD (P = 0.788 and P = 0.538, respectively).",N
id9779,The MPO and A2M polymorphisms are associated with sporadic AD in southern Italy,Y
id9771,"Our data showed that the APOE epsilon4 allele frequency in AD was significantly higher than that in the normal controls (chi2 = 11.66, P < 0.01) neither the frequencies of genotypes nor alleles of the TNF alpha-308 A/G and A2M polymorphisms were significantly different between AD and controls,suggesting the two polymorphisms were not risk factors to LOAD in Chinese.",N
id9785,The results of this study revealed no association between the I1000V polymorphism of A2M and Chinese sporadic AD in Guangzhou and Chengdu.,N
id9769,Through combination-analysis of the data about the A2M-I/D and the A2M-Ile1000Val variants the A2M gene was suggested to be associated with Alzheimer's disease.,Y
id9767,Our results indicate that the CTCG haplotype of LRP1 may reduce the risk of late-onset AD but A2M is not associated with this disease in the Han Chinese population.,A
id28186,"Although LRP as well as RAP seem to play an essential role in the metabolism of alpha2M and APOE, there is no increase in the genetic risk for AD in patients carrying the investigated polymorphisms.",N
id48755,"Our data suggest that the CTSD-T allele of the CTSD-C/T polymorphism is associated with an increased relative risk for late-onset AD and, more interestingly, the combination of CTSD-T with the A2M-G allele seems to increase this risk.",Y
id57422,"ACE was also part of significant 2 and 3-locus MDR-PDT joint effects models with Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (A2M), which mediates the clearance of Abeta, and Leucine-Rich Repeat Transmembrane-3 (LRRTM3), a nested gene in Alpha-3 Catenin (CTNNA3) which binds Presenilin-1. This result did not replicate in the case-control sample, and may not be a true positive. These genes are related to Abeta clearance; thus this constellation of effects might constitute an axis of susceptibility for LOAD.",A
id101332,"Alpha 2-Macroglobulin gene (A2M) has been recognized as a candidate gene for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the association between several polymorphisms in A2M gene and risk for AD remained controversial. Our study supports that haplotype -88G/25G might play a protective role in the development of SAD, and the protective effects of -88G and 25G were independent of APOEvarepsilon4 allele.",A
id101336,"In conclusion our study suggests that LRP1-C/T, A2M-Ile/Val and APOE-epsilon 2/epsilon 3/epsilon 4 polymorphisms are associated with AD.",Y

id26351,Further we did not observe significant and replicated association of other ABCA1 SNPs we examined with the disease thus these ABCA1 variants do not appear to influence the risk of LOAD in this study.,N
id27095,However together with the reported associations of AD with APOE CYP46A1 and ABCA1 the present result adds a very significant support for the role of cholesterol and phospholipid homeostasis in AD and a rationale for testing novel cholesterol homeostasis-related therapeutic strategies in AD.,Y
id9733,"Based on the results of genome-wide screens, along with biological studies, we selected three genes as candidates for AD risk factors: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) and cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H)... Although excellent biological candidates, the case-control dataset did not support the hypothesis that these three genes were associated with susceptibility to AD.",N
id127572,"Our data support the observation that ABCA1 polymorphisms influence cholesterol metabolism of the brain, but might not act as a major risk factor in AD.",A
id48757,Our data suggest a gender-specific and APOE and UBQLN1 independent association between the ABCA1/R219K polymorphism and LOAD.,Y
id28203,We show an apparent weak association of rs2230806 (p-value=0.01) with the disease in a sibpair series of Alzheimer's disease that had shown previously evidence for linkage to the chromosome 9 locus where ABCA1 maps.,Y

id9299,Our results suggest that APOE and ACE genotypes may be independent risk factors for late-onset AD but the ACE association needs to be confirmed in independent samples in which the time and extent of vascular cofactors can be assessed.,A
id9408,"We performed an association analysis of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genes, known to be involved in vascular disorders, and AD. We did not find significant associations between the polymorphisms studied and AD.",N
id9312,We conclude that  ACE genotype is a risk factor for late onset AD.,Y
id9120,Paraoxonase ACE and MTHFR polymorphisms were not associated with VD or LOAD; these common polymorphisms might have a marginal role in the pathogenesis of dementia in older subjects.,Y
id127980,In conclusion ACE D and apo epsilon 4 allele were found to be more frequent in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in the control group.,Y

id128023,"In a study of 261 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and 306 cognitively normal control subjects from Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, we found no association between genotype counts or allelic frequencies of DCP1, the gene encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme",N
id128038,"We conclude therefore that the frequency of ACE I-allele is not increased in AD and, in autopsy-confirmed AD cases, possession of the ACE I allele has no impact upon the pathology of AD, at least in terms of the amount of Abeta or tau deposited in the brain.",N

id128061,A deletion polymorphism at intron 16 of the ACE gene has also been associated with AD.,Y
id9406,"There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of the DCP1* insertion/deletion alleles between the cases and controls (X2 =0.04, 1 degree of freedom, not significant).",N
id128089,Results support a model whereby decreased ACE activity may influence AD susceptibility by a mechanism involving beta-amyloid metabolism.,A
id8961,Using logistic regression and multiple correlation analysis (MCA) we confirmed that the main risk factor associated and consistently grouped with AD patients in this population is APOE4 but this association was not observed with alleles and genotypes of ACE and A2M.,N
id128150,The I allele of the ACE D/I polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of late-onset AD.,Y
id128154,"These results provide an important complement to existing AD risk data, confirming that ACE harbors sequence variants that contribute to aspects of AD pathology.",Y
id9048,Here we report that polymorphisms within the APOE promoter ACE1 and CYP46 gene are not risk factors for AD and are not associated with parenchymal or vascular accumulation of Abeta.,N
id128260,"Different studies have investigated the effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism on the risk of Alzheimer dementia (AD)... We found the I/I genotype to be associated with an increased risk of AD, but not with the risk of VD.",Y

id128308,"These results confirm the association of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme indel with Alzheimer's disease across diverse populations, although this is probably due to linkage disequilibrium with the true risk factor.",Y
id28581,"The risk of AD was also significant for people with ACE DD genotype, D allele, or T-D haplotype [OR (95% CI) = 4.29 (1.96-10.23), 1.90 (1.35-2.70), or 2.91 (1.71-5.10), respectively].",Y
id128376,Several lines of evidence support for a role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in Alzheimer disease (AD). Most genetic studies have focused on an Alu insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the ACE gene (DCP1) and have yielded conflicting results. .. These results suggest that a variant in close proximity to rs4343 and rs4351 modulates susceptibility to AD in this community.,Y
id128405,"The involvement of the ACE D/I polymorphism in the pathogenesis of DWMHs in dementia (AD and VaD), by a mechanism that is independent of its association with cardiovascular risk factors, should be confirmed in a large population-based sample.",Y

No global haplotype effect could be observed on the risk of AD.",Y
id75413,"The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a protease involved in blood pressure regulation, has been implicated as an important candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD)...

id61754,The presence of APOE epsilon4 was associated with a significantly higher incidence of progression to AD whereas the presence of BCHE-K had no independent effect on progression.,Y
id61780,APOE epsilon 4 may influence rate of cognitive decline most significantly in the earliest stages of Alzheimer disease.,A
id61783,APOE epsilon4 is a very strong risk factor for AD in the population of central Norway and lowers age at onset of LOAD significantly.,Y
id61785,"Thirteen gene-gene interactions between the loci of LHB, LHCGR, and APOE were associated with AD.",Y
id61887,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Abeta) levels are promising endophenotypes for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and show correlation with LOAD status and Abeta deposition. Alleles in ACE, APOE, BDNF, DAPK1, and TF are significantly associated with CSF Abeta levels.",Y
id92099,Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is an age related neurodegenerative disease with a high prevalence that places major demands on healthcare resources in societies with increasingly aged populations. We have validated the pooling method for GWA studies by both identifying the APOE locus and by observing a strong enrichment for significantly associated SNPs.,Y
id61982,"The influence of APOE epsilon4 and NOS3 G alleles on the risk of AD was independent of homocysteine, vitamin B12 levels and MTHFR status.",Y
id62012,In the oldest old the presence of the APOE epsilon2 allele (APOE2) was associated with a somewhat reduced risk of dementia but paradoxically was associated with increased Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology.,Y
id62052,"Logistic regression analysis showed that the highest risk for AD was found for individuals who co-inherited APOE epsilon4 allele, PRNP codon 129 homozygosity, PRND codon 174 Thr allele, and CYP46 rs754203 g allele.",Y
id62170,Our findings suggest that lower plasma apoE levels in middle age could be a risk factor for Alzheimer disease in old age independent of APOE genotype.,Y
id62168,"Overall, the level of insoluble Abeta, but neither oligomeric nor soluble Abeta, was associated with Braak stage, CAA severity and APOEepsilon4 frequency, raising questions as to the role of soluble and oligomeric Abeta in the progression of AD.",Y
id92087,"We undertook a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involving over 16,000 individuals, the most powerful AD GWAS to date. In stage 1 (3,941 cases and 7,848 controls), we replicated the established association with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) locus (most significant SNP, rs2075650, P = 1.8 x 10(-157)) and observed genome-wide significant association with SNPs at two loci not previously associated with the disease: at the CLU (also known as APOJ) gene (rs11136000, P = 1.4 x 10(-9)) and 5' to the PICALM gene (rs3851179, P = 1.9 x 10(-8)).",Y
id62180,The results suggest that APOE epsilon4 and heavy drinking and heavy smoking lower the age of onset for AD in an additive fashion.,Y
id62240,These results suggest that APOE genotype may influence the topography of regional atrophy and cortical thinning in AD.,A
id107442,"Finally, in the group of demented patients for the APO-E gene we found a statistically significant presence of the E4 allele, whereas no difference was found for the polymorphisms of the ACE gene. Our observations corroborate the possible presence of a pro-inflammatory environment in AD patients, partly sustained by the low expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine genes when defined alleles are present.",Y
id107439,In this sample of first-degree relatives receiving genetic susceptibility testing for AD an APOE epsilon4 genotype status was positively associated with dietary supplement use after risk disclosure.,Y
id107453,The NEP and ApoE gene polymorphisms may be associated with SAD.,A
id107461,This study provides support for the relationship between APOE epsilon4 and risk of AD in Latino individuals.,Y
id107498,These data suggest that AD is associated with lower CSF SAM levels and that this is at least partly due to an association of the APOE4 allele with reduced SAM levels in the CSF.,Y
id107518,Markers at the APOE locus were associated with all phenotypes except white matter lesion volume (all false discovery rate-corrected P values < .001). Novel and established AD loci identified by prior GWASs showed a significant cumulative score-based effect (false discovery rate P = .04) on all analyzed neuroimaging measures.,Y
id107560,"Association study of AD and CLU, PICALM, CR1, and APOE genotypes. APOE _4 was significantly associated with AD (ORs, 1.80-9.05) in all but 1 small white cohort and in the Arab cohort.",Y
id107566,Apo E is not a risk factor nor a protective one for AD whereas the leu allele of GPX1 is a possible risk factor for the disease.,N
id172312,In addition to known candidate genes APOE TOMM40 and one hypothetical gene LOC100129500 partially overlapping APOE; one novel gene EPC2 and several other interesting genes were associated with CSF biomarkers that are related to AD. These findings especial,Y

One of the six polymorphisms, a 6.6/7.3 kb (kb = 10(3) base-pairs) EcoRI restriction fragment length polymorphism, is loosely associated with the presence of Alzheimer's disease in a population of 34 subjects.",Y
id7055,Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) has been shown to be associated with three distinct point mutations within the same codon of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene.,Y
id7059,"Mutations found in the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene in a small subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with the development of the disease... Although no particular alleles are associated with AD, this newly identified polymorphic site may be useful in other genetic analyses since preliminary evidence suggests allele frequency differences between African Americans and Caucasians.",A
id7057,The majority of the Colombian AD cases predominantly late-onset were negative for PSEN and APP mutations.,N
id27340,The -9G/C and ? APP promoter polymorphisms are unlikely to contribute strongly to AD susceptibility or to cause major differences in APP expression but the ? allele warrants further study for association with AD in larger population samples.,A
id7051,"To overcome this limitation, nine polymorphisms in seven different candidate genes (A2M, ACT, APOE, APP, BH, HSP70-2, and IL1-A) were genotyped... Except for the APOE gene, allele and genotype frequencies were not different between cases and controls, even when stratifying for the APOE genotype.",N

Four previously recognized pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 gene (H163R, M139V) and APP gene (T714A, V715A), and three novel putative mutations in PSEN1 gene (P117R and I213F) and PSEN2 gene (Q228L) were identified. It could be concluded that screening for mutations in the three genes could be included in a diagnostic program directed at patients with a positive family history or age of onset before 55 years.",Y

id29797,The present study provides evidence that APP-promoter mutations that significantly increase APP expression levels are associated with AD.,Y

id29801,"By contrast, analysis of three recently described rare mutations influencing APP transcription did not confirm their association with AD risk.",N
id29803,"We concluded that the variation in the screened exons of the APP and PSEN1 genes, reportedly associated with familial AD, is not present in LOAD.",Y

id6865,No significant association of this polymorphism with the occurrence of AD can be established. Larger sample size may be necessary to identify other potential mutations/polymorphisms among BACE gene.,N
id6871,"It appears that BACE polymorphism plays a more important role in the development of AD than previously assumed, possibly by influencing Abeta(42) levels.",Y
