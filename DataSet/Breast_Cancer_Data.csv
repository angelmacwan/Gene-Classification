DBN_976,"We here show for the first time that the most common genomic copy number gains in breast cancer, 1q21 and 1q32, are associated with overexpression of the ETS transcription factors ETV3 and ELF3 (but not ELK4) at these loci irrespective of molecular subtypes.",X

DBN_98,Women with TN breast cancer diagnosed below 50 years have >10% likelihood of carrying a BRCA1 mutation and are therefore eligible for testing in most centres.,X
DBN_980,The provided information may facilitate the design of independent studies to validate the association between USPL1 rs7984952 and risk of Grade 3 breast tumors.,X
DBN_982,Our aim was to address the possible role of genetic polymorphisms in LAMTOR2 and LAMTOR3 as genetic risk factors for breast cancer.,X
DBN_983,We sequenced the exons and exon-intron boundaries of LAMTOR2 (p14) and LAMTOR3 (MP1) in 50 prospectively collected pairs of cancerous tissue and blood samples from breast cancer patients and compared their genetic variability.,X
DBN_984,The identified polymorphisms in LAMTOR2 and LAMTOR3 do not seem to play a relevant role in breast cancer.,N

DBN_986,We sequenced the exons and exon-intron boundaries of LAMTOR2 (p14) and LAMTOR3 (MP1) in 50 prospectively collected pairs of cancerous tissue and blood samples from breast cancer patients and compared their genetic variability.,X
DBN_987,The identified polymorphisms in LAMTOR2 and LAMTOR3 do not seem to play a relevant role in breast cancer.,N
DBN_988,"However, when we additionally genotyped rs148972953 in the MARIE study including 2,715 breast cancer cases and 5,216 controls, we observed neither a difference in genotype frequencies between patients and controls nor was the SNP associated with ER or PR.",X
DBN_989,"Of these, 155 experienced BCR and 214 did not, after a median duration of follow up after breast cancer diagnosis of 6.35 years (range = 0.60-21.78) and 8.60 years (range = 3.08-13.57), respectively.",X
DBN_990,We can conclude that the rs10046 polymorphism on CYP19 by itself does not constitute breast cancer risk.,N
DBN_992,"Seven of the 19 markers were significant in a multivariate predictive model of familial breast cancer in AJ women, three novel SNPs [rs17663555(5q13.2), rs566164(6q21), and rs11075884(16q22.2)], the FGFR2 haplotype, and three previously published SNPs [rs13387042(2q35), rs2046210(ESR1), and rs3112612(TOX3)], yielding moderate predictive power with an area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC (receiver-operator characteristic curve) of 0.74.",X
DBN_993,"Four haplotypes within two genes (NBS1 and BRIP1) involved in the monoubiquitinated FANCD2-DNA damage-repair pathway are significantly associated with increased sporadic breast cancer risk, while one haplotype within NBS1 is correlated with an increased risk of familial or early-onset breast cancer, indicating that specific haplotypes may be distinct predictors of breast cancer.",Y
DBN_994,"Among these, four haplotypes (ATC in block 1 of NBS1, GCCCC and GCCCT in block 2 of NBS1, and GCT in block 2 of BRIP1) were correlated with breast cancer risk in sporadic cases (OR (95% CI) 1.350(1.124-1.623), 0.752(0.584-0.969), 0.803(0.649-0.993), and 0.776(0.604-0.997), respectively), and only one haplotype (GGCCT in block 2 of NBS1) was significantly associated with breast cancer risk in familial and early-onset cases (OR(95% CI) 1.902(1.134-3.191)).",Y
DBN_995,The purpose of this study was to determine whether SIPA1 545 C > T polymorphism was associated with overall survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,X
DBN_996,"In this study, SIPA1 545 C > T polymorphism was detected in 185 metastatic breast cancer patients using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (PCR-RFLP).",X
DBN_997,We found that SIPA1 545 C > T polymorphism was significantly associated with survival in 185 patients with metastatic breast cancer.,Y
DBN_998,Our findings indicate that metastatic breast cancer patients with SIPA1 545 T/T genotype have a poorer survival compared to patients with C/C or C/T genotype.,X
